      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Jesper, a frontend web developer and aspiring full-stack engineer with a passion for building intelligent, responsive, and highly functional digital experiences. My journey in web development has been shaped by a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS‚Äîtools I use to bring elegant interfaces and interactive applications to life. Over time, I've expanded my expertise into backend development and API integration, building projects that are both user-centric and technically robust.</p>
      <p>One of my key strengths is developing APIs that are efficient, scalable, and developer-friendly. Whether it's crafting RESTful endpoints from scratch or integrating third-party services, I focus on clean architecture and clarity. I believe in writing modular code that can grow with the application, and I‚Äôm comfortable working with JSON, HTTP methods, and middleware. My APIs are always well-documented, easy to consume, and built to handle real-world business logic.</p>
      <p>On the frontend, I pride myself on building responsive, accessible, and performance-optimized interfaces. I craft websites and apps that not only look great but also work seamlessly across all devices. My workflow includes semantic HTML, component-based design, mobile-first strategy, and deep care for usability.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm also passionate about data visualization. I build interactive dashboards and charts using Chart.js and D3.js that help users interpret real-world data with ease. From KPIs to trend graphs, I enjoy the challenge of turning numbers into stories people can act on.</p>
